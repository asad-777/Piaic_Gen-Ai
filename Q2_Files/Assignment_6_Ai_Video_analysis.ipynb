The video should convey a sense of speed, exhilaration, and a high-stakes chase. Use a synth-wave soundtrack and geometric, mesh-like overlays for a retro-futuristic feel. Transition from shots of the car moving quickly through the city to close-ups of its sleek design, showcasing the car’s movement. Include some slow-motion shots to enhance the visual impact. The video should give a feel of being in a high speed chase in a cyberpunk city with a synth-wave soundtrack. The city should feature a grid like road and have retro styled palm trees and sunsets.\""
