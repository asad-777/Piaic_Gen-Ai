# OpenAI Chat Completion API Parameters Explained

**Messages:** This is like a chat history. You give the API a list of messages, including what you've already said and what the AI has said before. This helps the AI understand the context of your current request.

**Model:** This is like choosing the AI's personality. Different models have different strengths.  Some are better at creative writing, others are better at answering factual questions. You pick the model that best suits your needs.

**Max Completion Tokens:** This sets a limit on how long the AI's response can be.  Think of tokens as words or parts of words.  Setting a limit keeps the response short and sweet, or long and detailed, depending on what you choose.

**n:** This lets you get multiple different responses from the AI at once.  It's like asking the same question in multiple ways and getting different answers.

**Stream:** This lets you get the AI's response bit by bit, instead of all at once. It's like watching a movie instead of just getting the whole thing at the end.

**Temperature:** This controls how creative the AI is. A high temperature means more creative, unpredictable responses, while a low temperature means more focused, direct responses.

**Top_p (nucleus sampling):**  Similar to temperature, this also controls randomness.  Instead of using a temperature threshold, it considers the most likely tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the `top_p` value.  It often leads to more focused and coherent responses than temperature alone.

**Tools:**  This lets you tell the AI to use external tools to help it answer your question. For example, you might tell it to use a search engine or a calculator.  This helps the AI access more information and improve its responses.


These parameters all work together to shape the AI's response. For example, you might use a specific model, set a low temperature for a factual question, and use a high number of max tokens to get a detailed answer.  Or you might use a different model, a higher temperature, and fewer tokens for a creative story.
