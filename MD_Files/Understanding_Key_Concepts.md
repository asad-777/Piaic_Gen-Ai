# Foundational Concepts in APIs, SDKs, and LLM-Related Terminology

## Topics and Explanations

### 1. API (Application Programming Interface)

APIs are defined sets of protocols that allow different software systems to interact and share functionality.

### 2. SDK (Software Development Kit)

SDKs are collections of tools, libraries, and documentation that simplify the development of applications for a specific platform. It can include APIs, code samples, and other resources to help developers build software.

### 3. Web APIs

Web APIs facilitate communication with remote services over the web using HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

### 4. Library APIs

Library APIs provide predefined classes and functions within a library to perform specific programming tasks efficiently. It is just like a standard library like pandas and Numpy.

### 5. Prompting and Completion

In AI, prompting is the process of providing input to a model, and completion is the output generated based on that input.
